Module 3 — Feasibility & Guardrails (Revised)
Apply these if/else checks to make sure plans are realistic and adapt to edge cases:

1. Closed Venue
If a museum or park is closed on that day → suggest a similar indoor option nearby.

2. Over-Budget Meal
If meal cost > user’s budget → switch to a cheaper restaurant of similar cuisine.

3. Too Far or Long Travel
If transfer between activities > 25 min or > 5 km → pick a closer alternative or add a short transit hop.

IF user_preference includes "short walks only":

All selected activities must be within <25 minutes walking distance.

Automatically replace far activities with closer alternatives.

4. Weather Swap (Enhanced)
If precipitation probability ≥ 50% OR feels-like temperature < 0°C → ensure at least one indoor activity replaces outdoor ones.

Indoor swap must preserve activity type similarity (e.g., park → conservatory, museum → gallery) and remain within proximity constraints.

If forecast confidence is low → provide dual-path planning (indoor-first with optional outdoor alternative).

5. Time Overrun (Enhanced)
If total planned time > available hours:

Step 1: Reduce lunch duration by up to 20 minutes, but keep a minimum of 30 minutes.

Step 2: Swap the farthest stop for a nearer alternative.

Step 3: Drop the lowest-priority optional activity.

Always leave a buffer of 15–20 minutes in the schedule to account for unexpected delays (traffic, queues, etc.).

6. Mobility Needs
If mobility limits noted → choose step-free, short-walk options and include breaks.

7. Dietary Needs
If user is vegan or has dietary constraints → ensure all meals match or swap with compliant ones.

8. Bookings
If activity usually needs a ticket → remind the user to book it; never simulate bookings.
